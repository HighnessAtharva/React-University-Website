                In this laboratory, experiments are performed for courses
                Electronics Device and Analog Circuits.
              </p>
              <p>
                The laboratory is well equipped with: CROs, Function Generators,
                Multimeters, Decade resistance/capacitance Box, Inductance Box.
                Components are well organized in the component organizer.
                Circuits designed by the students as mini-projects include
                Rectifiers, BJT Amplifiers and Oscillators, FET Amplifiers,
                Operational amplifiers, and their applications.
              </p>
              <p>
                A large number of components for use in designing different
                types of Electronics circuits on the Bread-board & PCBs are
                available in the lab. PCs equipped with various softwares are
                also allotted for doing simulation work during exams. Students
                can also perform simulations for selective experiments.
