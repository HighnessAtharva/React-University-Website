                The Basic Electrical Lab at Sardar Patel Institute of Technology
                is equipped with a comprehensive range of instruments and
                facilities to facilitate hands-on learning and experimentation
                in the field of electrical engineering. The lab serves as a
                vital resource for students to gain practical experience and
                deepen their understanding of fundamental electrical principles
                and applications.
              </p>
              <p>
                Key instruments available in the lab include both AC and DC
                motors along with motor drives, enabling students to study
                various aspects of motor operation and control. Additionally,
                there are advanced tools such as digital storage oscilloscopes,
                power scopes, RLC meters, digital watt meters, and digital
                energy meters, providing students with the means to measure and
                analyze electrical signals, power consumption, and energy usage.
              </p>
              <p>
                The lab is further equipped with a DC power supply capable of
                delivering voltages ranging from 0 to 200 volts and currents up
                to 25 amps, allowing students to power their experiments and
                projects effectively. The lab access to the students is
                available for Moreover, students have the opportunity to design
                and implement driver circuits for electrical motors, applying
                theoretical concepts to practical circuitry and gaining valuable
                hands-on experience in circuit design and implementation.
